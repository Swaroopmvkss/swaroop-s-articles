	<h1>RULES I THOUGHT WORTH FOR THE INVESTMENT</h1>
	<p>
CONSIDERATIONS:
The main things to consider when we are planning for an investment are
1. How much money you want to invest
2. how much money you are able to loss
Out of these two points the second point is what most people don’t consider
because many people don’t even like to think of a loss, but in reality loss is also a 
chance. So consider these things before you are going to invest.
CAPITAL ARRANGEMENT:
After considering all the things lets have a look at how much capital you have, then 
think of the ways to arrange the capital when it is not sufficient. Enter the dragon only if you 
have enough capital to invest and also to survive even after something went wrong in 
business. That defense is what most of the people don’t arrange, it is like entering the battle 
field without the shield if you enter investment without keeping some money with you.
CHOOSING RIGHT SLOT:
Choosing the right place to invest is the must thing to consider. Because after 
investing the money that money will be out of control for you. So before investing think 
deeply and think practically and then only you enter the acton.
BE ADAPTABLE TO PRESENT DAY:
In business it is common that our product or service having decline in its salability. So 
you must have continuous observation about what is happening around you in the world. 
Then only you can understand the changing mindset of the people , it is helpful both for 
investment and business.
DON’T BE SUPERSTITIOUS:
Some people have the superstitions about the business like some people believe the 
astrology to invest, and some people believe the numerology. So I am not saying they don’t
work but I am trying to convey a point that doing investment like that will be like putting a 
bet, means we are believing a chance without considering possibilities of being profitable.
DON’T TRY FOR LONG JUMPS IN THE BEGINNING:
Many people enter the investment with a big expectation of the profit, but here 
what they are lack of is patience and reality. So in business we don’t take decisions in 
emotions, we have to be balanced emotionally. This balance we have to maintain 
throughout in our journey of business in order to be a successful business man or a 
successful investor. So aiming for the profit is must in the business but we must consider the 
time it take in reality.
