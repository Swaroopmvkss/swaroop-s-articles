	<h1>MUSIC</h1>
	<p>Music is the pleasant thing to hear. Every music bit or music composed for a song comes from 7 
syllables. They are Sa, Re, Ga, Ma, Pa, Dha, Ni. Every musical composition is permutations and 
combinations of this 7 syllables. Music is something that is composed for a tune with proper 
instrumentation. 
The proper matching of instruments to a particular tune gives us the good music. Some musical 
albums, or some musical bits remain ever-lasting because of one of 2 reasons, that is either because 
of the uniqueness in the tune, or because of uniqueness of instrumentation. Often we hear 2 types 
of music namely classical music and western music. 
The sound differs from kind of instruments used for composition. Earlier in India we know only 
classical music. But in later time we are introduced with western music, this gave a freshness to our 
way of listening music. We are introduced with new instruments due to introduction of western
music in Indian culture. 
The inspiration to music if we think of olden days may be nature, because in nature if we observe we 
can listen pleasant sounds of birds, sounds of water falls, sounds of flowing rivers, sounds of sea 
tides, like that we can listen many pleasant sounds from the nature. Listening to those sounds in a 
combination may gave some inspiration initially in olden days. Nature gave instinct to create 
pleasant sounds, and later after learning how to talk, human being learnt how to give tune to words, 
or else giving words to tune. Gradual advancement and development brought music to the present 
state.
Well composed music can give us good relaxation, no doubt in that, but the opposite can give bad 
irritation, not only bad, sometimes vintage music seems like that, it may be great in those days.
Musical taste varies from every individual, it varies because of kind of music introduced in childhood, 
means the kind of music we heard in childhood will go deep in our mind. So thatâ€™s why the kind of 
music we heard in childhood will be heart touching for us. </p>
