	<h1>AI GOING TO TAKE AWAY HUMAN INTELLIGENCE ?</h1>
	<p>This is the heated up discussion in the present scenario. The need to use the human brain keeps on 
decreasing. I will try to give the analogy of how the need to use the brain kept on decreasing from years of 
inventions. At first, when humans learnt to communicate in a particular language they understand, they used 
to transfer the information through words. This is the phase when human brains are working with maximum 
capability. Later after invention of script for the language, the next generation can refer books, to learn the 
previous generations and upgrade further. In this phase, the need to remember everything had decreased, but 
there is no effect on the thinking power, because there is available information, we need to remember the 
things because always referring the book also hard. This is all the hand written information. 
Same thing after the invention of printing press also, but the printing press gave scope to newspapers, 
and to print more content as it is faster than writing. Up to now, there is no effect on the thinking power of 
humans. Now fast forwarding some years in history, we had a great invention called the computer. Initially, it 
started making calculations, and later it started applying logic to the given data. So, at this point humans don’t 
need to think for mathematical and logical operations, as computer is performing those operations. At this 
time, the access to internet for computer made the transfer of information easy. In the later stage, the manual 
operations are slowly shifted to computers, and the network became fast, so easy to access any information. 
Again a major change in the technology, that is smartphone, access to information became much easier. 
In all these advancements the access to information became easy, and only logical and mathematical 
operations are performed by computers. But when the time the AI entered, it started taking input information, 
process the information and giving defined output. This is the major change all over the world. With the 
notable advancements in AI, it is now the time of chatgpt. Also we have devices to track our thoughts even 
now, or in near future. So, it is a possibility that if we are not conscious, the AI can dominate humans, and it 
can be out of human control if it is given the more freedom. So humans have to keep the advancements 
regarding AI in a helpful manner, not in a harmful manner.
So in a minor level I can say that, keep the habit of reading books, solving puzzles so that it can keep 
the brain working, so our brain can be conscious of the world, then there will be no chance of losing the 
thinking power. Thinking power is more important than memory. If thinking capability of AI become more than 
human capability, it will be a dominant. And human don’t have physical work and mental work, so then why 
we are there? So another thing is that with advancements new kind of opportunities will arise. We have to 
upgrade the knowledge to grab the opportunities. There is no loss of opportunities, there will be change of 
kind of opportunities available.
