	<p>WHAT IS GOOD OR BAD FOR HEALTH?
I’m not a doctor, and I’m not a physician, but I’m trying to give some logical view of the 
general misconceptions regarding the health. Many people are health freaks, and fitness freaks, but 
they need to be health conscious, and need not to be freaks for their wellbeing. Because the 
difference between health conscious person and the health freak is that the health conscious person 
will think before eating something, but health freak person will have the internal fear when they eat 
something. This is not a good thing, because even a small change in their body will make them tense, 
either it is good or bad.
The same scenario arises regarding diet also. People will follow over diet, or no diet in
majority. This is about major percentage of people, so it is the correct thing to change diets 
according to the conditions we are in, like amount of work we are doing as we work more we have 
to eat more, and climatic conditions, because in cold climate digestion is slow, and in hot climate the 
digestion is fast. Actually we have to manage the diet according to the conditions we are in. 
otherwise, blindly following a particular format will give a negative impact.
The habitation of the body must be flexible. For suppose, we are habituated to eat less food 
for a long time, then after some days it is unable for the body to take even a little excess. Same thing 
will apply vice versa, so we have to plan a flexible diet. If we eat solidly at least 2 days a week, and 
remaining 4 days in diet, then it will manage. In this manner our body can sustain flexibility.
Another problem we can observe in the people is, sometimes people focus on the way they 
look while following the diet, and ignoring the side effects of that. For example, keeping something 
like so called 6 pack will have negative effects, if it is maintained for long time. Not only 6 pack, the 
same thing for 0 size also. So, when it comes to following diet to maintain the shapes, it must be on 
and off. Not only this, any kind of diet must be on and off. We have to keep that flexibility for the 
body to avoid the negative effects when are becoming old. At young age we cannot find that, but 
when we become old these things will start showing the effect. When we are preparing a diet 
resume, we have to keep these things in mind.
