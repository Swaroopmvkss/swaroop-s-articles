	<h1>PARENTING</h1>
	<p>Parenting is not only giving knowledge of the world around by our knowledge or 
experience of life. And another thing is imbibing the fear of doing wrong things is another 
part of parenting. I want to focus mainly on this point because in today’s world that is what 
we are lack of, in the kids. Fear is an defensive instinct against doing wrong, or protecting 
from wild animals, and so on. We have to make the children understand the ill effects of 
doing wrong things, that will automatically create fear in the children, so that there is no 
drive for them to commit wrong things.
Firstly, we have to see the fear positively and then we will get the whole point. That 
means there must be required fear in the society, but we don’t imbibe unnecessary fears 
into the society. What stops doing wrong is fear of punishment, if the student don’t have 
the fear of punishment he don’t take studies seriously, this is true because we can see the 
lack of quality in the students after restricting the teachers on about giving punishment to 
students. Means, an average student at present is the level of below average student some 
days back.
Secondly, the main point is giving the children the fear of threat, that can help to 
keep them on positive side of life. Fear of threat can give carefulness to the children. For 
example if we make them know the effects of not having proper education, the fear of 
unemployment can make them study carefully. The point is we have to imbibe the fear 
properly without giving unnecessary fears.
Third one is, we have to give the fear of law, lack of that now a days giving many bad 
outputs. There must be enough fear to commit crime, that will decrease the crime rate of 
any country. And we have to imbibe moral values along with the fear to get the proper mind 
to live in the society. Lack of fear of doing crime means it is the nature of the wild animal, it 
will do whatever it wants without thinking anything. 
And finally, and most importantly parenting also related to the follow-up of what we 
are teaching, that will also have the effect on the children. Means many parents will say 
good things but they don’t follow, that will break connection for the kids between theory 
and practical application in real life. So this thing also need to be changed because it is the 
environment around the kid that builds his mental structure or the mind. So automatically 
what they see will have more effect than what we told them in that age. This thing also 
should be taken care, especially in the growing ages of the children.
This are the points I liked to convey because I felt there must be enough fear to keep 
the life in proper track. We don’t get into unnecessary fears, or misconceptions, but we 
have to understand the reality, it will automatically give whatever is required. We have keep 
aside the fascination or unreal imagination in the real life.
