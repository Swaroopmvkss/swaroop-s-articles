	<h1>OPPORTUNITY VS TALENT</h1>
	<p>
Every person, either at the starting point of his career when he was trying to enter an 
earning job, or in the mid of his career when he is not satisfied with what he have will 
definitely think of two questions, they are why I am not getting good opportunities? this is 
the first question, and why I don’t have enough talent to reach highest goals? With these 
questions he or she used to struggle a lot. 
My point of view about this thing basically deals with what keeps people in a uncertain 
situation? Whether it is lack of hard-work or whether it is lack of confidence or whether it is 
matter of luck. First we will confine to one case then we then start contradicting ourselves. 
Let’s consider it happens because of lack of hard-work, the persons who are doing most 
harder jobs like lifting weights from one place to another place, pulling heavy loads are
working for daily wages, so here we raise a point that it is not about physical work, then the 
persons who reached highest positions don’t have mental strain.
So for a while we confine to a point that it is lack of confidence, it will work for some extent 
because it plays a crucial role in stepping forward in life without having more fear about 
what will happen next, and moving forward confidently doesn’t mean not having 
understanding of what we are doing. Most of the successful people have taken risky turns in 
their lives. All these things are fine until the confidence levels are in limit, if it crosses the 
border then we have to face the consequences. Anyways the confidence is needed but in a 
required level. But confidence is what we need only? A child who is ignorant of life and its 
struggles can live more confidently even in a naked position, so something more is needed 
other than confidence.
Now we have to move on to another point, that is talent. How can we define talent? Some 
people are successful by using their limited abilities, some people are successful by having 
more abilities, some people are still struggling from both the sections. So definitely a certain 
amount of skill is needed even to start doing something. We cannot start writing without 
knowing even alphabets, in that way talent is required in addition to something, then what 
that something will be?
Now we have arrived at a crucial point, that is opportunity. Often one word follows 
opportunity, that is luck. We often listen a phrase “Bad luck! , day is not ours, opportunity is 
lost.”, so luck is something which can make a thing happen, it doesn’t mean we have to 
stop trying but it plays a role. A basic shuttle is between we have to search for the 
opportunities? Or we have to create our own opportunities? Both the things are correct in 
both ways. We have to create opportunities in the way of searching opportunities. For 
example, we are searching for a job, we have to search in all possible ways and at the same 
time we have to upgrade our skills then an opportunity is always there for us, so we have 
created an opportunity in the way of searching for it. 
After following all the things and trying all the ways still there is a chance of failure in 
reaching something we aimed at, but the probability of failure decreases when number of 
trails increases, and we will succeed if we realize whether it is lack of skill or lack of lack of 
luck or opportunity, there is a role of luck in the whole journey of our life, but it is not the 
only factor if we don’t depend on it, it is one of the factor that clears a small obstacle if you 
are equipped to travel in the way you have chosen.
By this essay, I have tried to explain the role of talent and some other factors in getting an 
opportunity by trying to make an understanding of reality of the luck on which we often 
depend on. </p>
