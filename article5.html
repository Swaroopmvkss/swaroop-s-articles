	<p>MY TAKE ON CHANGE OF YUGAS
Often we come across this dilemma, like what happens at the end of the Yuga, and 
what circumstances indicate the end of the Yuga? These type of questions we get into our 
minds when we listen to the mythological stories because there it is mentioned that most of 
the Gods are lived on this earth in the previous Yugas. Actually there is no end for this 
discussion, as the whole discussion moves on the assumptions. So first thing is what exactly 
the end of the Yuga mean, as it like completion of the month, year, decade, century like 
that? Or a huge distraction happens and every life is washed out? We will try to think of it in 
different ways. I will try to explain using two cases.
Case – 1: Our environment is cyclical, regarding rains, heat waves and everything. So let’s 
assume end of Yuga as such a cyclical moment, there is a possibility that something like a 
huge tsunami happens with the water bodies as a combined effect because we have 70 per
cent water and 30 per cent land part. This is also a reason why most of the films or 
documentaries visualize end of Yuga as a treat with water bodies.
Case – 2: Let’s leave the thought of destruction at the end of Yuga, it will give another 
perspective. We invented terms like kilometres, later on light years to measure large 
astronomical distances. Likewise we invented terms like years, decades, centuries and also 
Yuga to measure large number of years. It will not give any confusion and the life is in 
continuation, so in this case Darwin theory is not contradicted, as there is continuation in 
evolution.
Consider these two possible cases. And we cannot prove anything as we have
standard historical evidences hardly from 500BC. So as per the traces we have now, the 
characters mentioned in the mythology lived on this earth at some time, but we don’t have 
proper timeline of their life span, years of ruling etc.
Coming to another point of discussion, that is why some kingdoms are immersed in 
water bodies? This is possible because as kingdoms like Lanka, Dwaraka are on the sea side, 
so floods or too-fan is quite a possible thing. And most of the other kingdoms traces are on 
the surface or some are under the soil because soil erosion happens. So these are the 
possibilities.
Vedas are like way of living with nature, using it in a friendly way, and praying it with 
gratitude for what it had given to us, and there are mentions about art, and medical 
treatments and so on. The mythological stories are most probably the stories of people who 
lived according to Vedas. So in the olden days there is no concept of script to write a 
language, later it came. There is chance for word of mouth to loss its originality while 
transmitting to different people. And in puranas also we get different versions. So a link is 
missed in between in the whole history, this gave rise to different assumptions in the minds 
of the people. Concept of Yuga may be among one of those assumptions.
On a whole, my point is just to make a logical analysis of what had happened that 
may help to give rise for a different perspective on the history.
