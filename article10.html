	<h1>WRONG PARENTING</h1>
	<p> 
I will start this article with a line that is, ‘stop talking is better than talking nonsense’. 
This is exactly what I want to follow up throughout this article. I am taking the side of 
children to explain their struggle, and I am taking the side of parents to explain their 
ignorance and nature of forcing their children towards their thoughts in their minds.
I start with a child’s thought process while he is growing. When he start schooling 
starting it is like storing information in the mind and slowly the thinking develops as he is 
getting information and he starts knowing the options he have slowly when he arrives at the 
high school grade. In that process an interest develops in him regarding a particular subject 
or particular area of study. 
He realizes it when he have to choose a main subject or area of study in the college. 
This is very crucial time where a person needs freedom to choose, because that decides his 
career. As the profession automatically follows the education, it will be good and satisfying 
for the person. This is the time where there is fault, there is influence of teachers and most 
importantly parents while choose his main course of study.
Now, I like to take the parents side, actually every parent wishes good future for his 
children. But the problem is some parents are not even aware of they are spoiling their 
offspring’s future. They force their sons or daughters to join some course without knowing 
their ability and interest. This is not intentional, but happens out of ignorance, they think 
they are putting their children in the right path but they are not aware that they are actually 
putting them into a struggle. If hard work is accompanied with interest then the output will 
be good. This is the point that some parents don’t realize, I am not generalizing. 
Many people talk about many problems regarding children but this is the problem 
which needs focus in people’s minds. Parents need to leave that dictatorship kind of 
attitude about the family, I am not saying parents have to leave children and see whatever 
they do, they have to look whether they are taking good path or not, and at the right time 
regarding their education they need to give freedom for their son or daughter to choose the 
career path.
And finally a comparative aspect is there that if you take that course you get that 
earning or someone’s son or daughter did some course so my son or daughter have to do 
that for earning or for the prestige aspect they have and in that time they ignore their own 
children’s interests and abilities. This is also a problem with some parents.
I am making these points based on my observation, and I am not saying that these 
things happen with every family, but these kind of things are definitely happening with 
some families where we are losing some educated workforce and in a way we can say that 
this is also a reason for the dropouts from the college apart from financial or other reasons.
So these problems regarding parenting definitely needs focus and all the parents need to 
realize and be sensible about what they are doing under the umbrella of parenting.
