	<h1>MY ANALYSIS OF THE SOCIETY</h1>
	<p>PART - 1
SHIFT OF FOCUS IN SOCIETY
The launching pad for my analysis is discussing about the focus of society. The society mainly focuses 
on the unnecessary things, or else it deviates from the main thing easily. That’s why, many criminals 
can easily manipulate people and commit bad things. So, this kind of attitude have to be changed, 
that means the society have to get the right focus on the issues. I will try to give you a simple 
scenario, for example, two groups are fighting for a reason and it is shown in a television, what 
attracts the society first is the dispute, and later the words they are listening, for example the 
particular news channel is taking one side, automatically society believes it. Here focus is shifted to
one side, and we don’t even think that other side may be right. This is called the shift of focus by 
influence of media, I’m not trying to convey that only media is doing, I just took a scenario. 
PART – 2
MISCONCEPTION 
This is the another major thing. Misconception happens in the society because many people will see 
only one side of the coin. So in that case, the other side is ignored, that doesn’t mean it is not there. 
We can see people are ignorant of the other side of the thing many times, so it is because of either 
they believe what they hear, or they think only one side. As long as this kind of people are there, it is 
easy for someone to manipulate or create wrong understanding of what is going on. This thing have 
to be changed in the society to get right intent of what is happening.
PART – 3
DEFAULT CONSIDERATIONS
This is another problem in the society. Default consideration means consideration based on our 
mind impression without knowing the thing. This happens often in many ways. For example, we see 
a drug addict as a bad person, this is the default consideration. But, he is actually a victim, because 
he is unable to come out of it. So he needs a treatment, but society harasses him. I’m not supporting 
drugs, but I’m trying to give other side of the thing. So in this way at least some percent of the 
society can be made pure.
PART – 4
MAKING CONCLUSIVE STATEMENTS
I want to start this by a note, ’Conclusion stops thinking’. This is absolutely correct. People often 
conclude things. If we conclude something in a half way, we cannot get full picture of the thing. So if 
we leave the mind for understanding, it will give opinions, not conclusions. The psychological aspect 
is conclusion gives a sigh of relief, that’s why people conclude things up to their knowledge. Once 
something is concluded, it will be carry-forwarded in the same way. So the things have to be left 
open ended. So it’s better to stop making conclusive statements.
PART - 5
EXAGGERATION OF THINGS
This is another thing that happens in the society. Basically, if we exaggerate something, it will spoil 
the reality. It is mostly observed in historical books, which describes the wars of kings. For suppose, 
an author in the kings court had written a book on his way of ruling, he will exaggerate the king’s 
strength, intelligence and everything to his level of satisfaction. Our only source is the book to know 
that time, so by comparing some books of different authors from foreign countries, we conclude 
something. This is not the actual reality. So this happens in many situations, not only this situation. 
PART – 6
BLAMING 
If we enter into process of blaming, we ignore ourselves. We hide our mistakes, but we are always 
ready to blame others. This will increase the self-acceptance and the reality erases in our mind, 
regarding good or bad, right or wrong and so on. This can be called as greed. So this thing has to be 
changed in the society. If we see the things logically we can get the correct understanding of the 
things. 
Note : This is my little understanding of society. Forgive the mistakes.
