	<h1>DIVORCE</h1>
	<p>I will express my view on increased rate of taking divorce after marriage compared to olden 
days. I can see 3 main reasons for this. I will explain the 3 reasons in 3 parts.
1) Awareness: This is one of the major change. In olden days there are less facilities to 
know the outside world. Means there are less means of communication, and only 
interaction happens with neighbors in those days. But now a days, either male or 
female have easy means of communications, so they can interact with friends, 
relatives and everyone easily due to advancement of technology. In this situation, 
automatically a comparative aspect will run in the minds and they will see for other 
options, so they feel that they can get better life if we get divorce or another 
marriage.
2) Independency: Now a days, either men or women are independent due to increase 
in rate of education, and awareness of the options they have for earning. And 
another reason is now a days women also aware of share of property they get from 
father’s family, and they are fearless because of awareness. So this is the another 
reason for rise of divorce rate. In olden days, female may have fear of how to survive 
if we leave the husband, but now this thing is gone. And independency in other 
sense we can say like, both the male and female also feeling superior, it became like 
fight between two parties.
3) Control – freak: Now a days as far as my knowledge, people became control – freak. 
They can’t bare even small misunderstandings, or small difference of opinions. So 
they are taking big decisions for small reasons. That is also another reason. The 
reasons couple are saying now a days for getting divorce may be very small issues in 
olden days because now a days people are lack of patience.
So, divorce is a legal option given by the constitution, no one have the right to oppose it. But
on the moral grounds, we have to look back on olden days to get the understanding of how
foolish we are in present days, means for small disputes we are getting divorce. </p>
